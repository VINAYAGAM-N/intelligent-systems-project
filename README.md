# 🧠 AI Assistant Project

This project contains three intelligent systems built using Python, NLP, and Speech technologies:

---

### 🔍 1. Sentiment Analysis
Identifies if a sentence expresses a positive or negative sentiment.  
Fetches relevant news articles based on sentiment.  
Uses Hugging Face Transformers and NewsAPI.

#### Sentiment Output

- **Positive Sentiment:**

- **Negative Sentiment:**

  ![Negative Sentiment](assets/sentiment_output_negative.png)

#### How It Works
- Analyzes user input using Hugging Face's `transformers` pipeline.
- Uses NewsAPI to fetch related articles based on the sentiment result.

### 🎙️ 2. Voice Assistant
Listens to voice commands.  
Responds with weather updates, jokes, or executes Google searches.  
Uses SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, and OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Voice Assistant Output

📹 [Watch Demo Video](assets/voice_assistant_demo.mp4)

#### How It Works
- Uses `speech_recognition` to listen to voice commands.
- Responds with `pyttsx3` TTS engine.
- Supports actions like:
  - Telling the time
  - Fetching weather
  - Telling jokes
  - Google or YouTube search

### 🏥 3. Healthcare Chatbot
Answers queries about diseases and symptoms.  
Suggests drug recommendations using FDA Drug API.  
Uses Wikipedia and fuzzy matching.

#### Chatbot Output

#### How It Works
- Extracts medical-related intents using `transformers` zero-shot classifier.
- Provides basic disease info from Wikipedia.
- Suggests drugs using the open FDA Drug API.
